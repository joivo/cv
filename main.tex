\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/ufcg-lsd/iguassu}{Iguassu} is a service for monitoring and performing e-science tasks in high-throughput computing in a multi-cloud environment. The resources used to perform these tasks are part of a cloud federation, managed by Fogbow middleware (fogbowcloud.org). Iguassu allows its users to use cloud resources without worrying about infrastructure details.
\item Developed the services that compound the Iguassu ecosystem, therefore components to the compilation, translation, scheduling and performing computational tasks described in a domain-specific language(i.e. \href{http://ourgrid.lsd.ufcg.edu.br/use.php#site1}{Jobs Description Language - JDF}) that make up the application.
\item I also wrote the automation of the deployment tasks, implementing mechanisms of CI/CD using tools like Ansible and simple orchestrators like Docker in swarm mode.
